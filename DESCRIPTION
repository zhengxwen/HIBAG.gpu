Description: It is an extensible component of the HIBAG package for imputing
    HLA genotypes using SNP data. HIBAG can be used by researchers with
    published parameter estimates instead of requiring access to large training
    sample datasets. It combines the concepts of attribute bagging, an ensemble
    classifier method, with haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA types.
    Attribute bagging is a technique which improves the accuracy and stability
    of classifier ensembles using bootstrap aggregating and random variable
    selection.
